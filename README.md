# My Cybersecurity Journey

Hello! I'm a first-year student studying Cybersecurity, and I'm starting my journey in learning basic tools and concepts. This repository is a documentation of my progress, experiences, and small projects I'm working on.

## Tools I Have Learned

- `Nmap`: For network scanning and discovering devices and services.
- `Nikto`: For web vulnerability scanning.
- `Dirb`: For discovering hidden files and directories in websites.
- `Burp Suite`: For web application penetration testing and vulnerability scanning.
- `Steghide`: For steganography (hiding and extracting files from images).

## Lessons and Experiences

- [ ] Write a guide for using Nmap
- [ ] Perform a basic scan of a local website using Nikto
- [ ] Try my first CTF challenge on HackTheBox
- [ ] Document using Burp Suite for web application testing

## Upcoming Tutorials

I will add written and/or video tutorials explaining how I use cybersecurity tools as a beginner.

Follow me on this journey!
